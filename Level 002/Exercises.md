### 1. **Grades System**

You have an array of grades:

```js
let grades = [95, 82, 67, 45, 33, 100, 77];
```

* Loop through each grade.
* Print:

  * `"A"` if grade â‰¥ 90
  * `"B"` if between 80â€“89
  * `"C"` if between 70â€“79
  * `"D"` if between 50â€“69
  * `"F"` if less than 50
* At the end, print **how many students got A and how many failed (F)**.

---

### 2. **Max & Min Finder**

You have an array of numbers:

```js
let nums = [4, 10, 2, 99, 23, 5];
```

* Find the **maximum** and **minimum** number using a `for` loop.
* Print them.

---

### 3. **Reverse Array**

You have an array:

```js
let letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];
```

* Print the elements in reverse order (from last to first) using a `for` loop.

---

### 4. **Multiplication Tables**

* Print multiplication tables from **1 to 5** (nested loop).
* Format:

  ```
  Table of 1
  1 x 1 = 1
  1 x 2 = 2
  ...
  Table of 2
  ...
  ```

---

### 5. **Search in Array**

You have an array:

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"];
```

* Ask the user (with `prompt`) to enter a fruit name.
* If it exists print: `"Found it!"`
* If it doesnâ€™t exist print: `"Not in the list!"`.

---

### 6. **FizzBuzz Challenge (Classic)**

Print numbers from 1 to 50:

* If divisible by 3 â†’ print `"Fizz"`
* If divisible by 5 â†’ print `"Buzz"`
* If divisible by both 3 and 5 â†’ print `"FizzBuzz"`
* Otherwise print the number itself.

---

### 7. **Even Numbers Counter**

You have a large array of numbers:

```js
let bigNums = [12, 45, 33, 2, 8, 19, 20, 100, 55];
```

* Count how many **even numbers** it has.
* Print the result.
