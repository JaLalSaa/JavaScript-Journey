# 🛤️ JavaScript Journey

Welcome to **JavaScript Journey**, a repository dedicated to collecting all the small files and experiments I create while learning **JavaScript**.
This repo is not for big projects — it’s purely for random tests, small ideas, and experiments.

---

## 📂 Repository Contents

* A collection of independent **JavaScript** experiments.
* Most experiments will have **CSS** and **JavaScript** written directly inside the same **HTML** file.
* Some experiments may contain **only vanilla JavaScript** without HTML or CSS.
* If a simple project is a bit bigger, it might be placed in a **separate folder** with CSS and JS separated for better organization.
* **Simple experiments** that are slightly bigger will still remain in **one HTML file** with CSS and JS included.
* **Larger experiments** will have files separated into folders with HTML, CSS, and JS split for clarity.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* Experiment with different **JavaScript** concepts without the pressure of building large projects.
* Keep a personal reference of random code snippets and ideas.
* Prepare to integrate these experiments into bigger projects later after mastering the language.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **JavaScript** (Vanilla JS)
* **HTML** & **CSS** (mainly inside the same file, unless the project is bigger)

---

## 🗓️ Future Plans

* Add more files for every new idea or test I try.
* Keep the repository as a record of my daily learning experiments.
* Gradually integrate DOM manipulation and advanced JS concepts with HTML/CSS when necessary.

---

## 🧪 Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JaLalSaa/JavaScript-Journey.git
   ```

2. **Open any HTML file** in a browser to run the experiment.

   * For pure JS files, you can run them in **Node.js** or open them in the browser console.

3. **Experiment freely** by modifying code and observing the output.

## 📝 Best Practices for Experiments

* **File Naming:** Use descriptive names for each experiment (e.g., `even-odd-checker.html`, `temperature-check.js`) to make them easy to find.
* **Organization:** Keep simple tests in single HTML files with embedded JS/CSS. For bigger experiments, create folders with separate files for clarity.
* **Comments:** Document your thought process and purpose for each experiment using inline comments.
* **Testing Vanilla JS:**

  * Open your `.js` files in **Node.js** using `node filename.js`.
  * Or use browser console: Open DevTools → Console → paste JS code.
  * **Quokka.js** extension (VSCode) allows live execution and inline results — perfect for fast experimentation.

## 📜 Notes

This repository is a personal log of my learning process, so some files might contain experimental or random code snippets.
It is designed for **practice and experimentation**, not for production.
